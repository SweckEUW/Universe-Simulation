We created this application for a Computer Graphics and Image Processing course. You can create your own universe by scanning an image. Simply draw an image by hand and scan the image with the application to create a proceduraly generated 3D universe. By drawing collored shapes and connections, the user can define various attributes like planet types, distance between planets and planet sizes. All planets are procedural generated by using noise functions and therefore never look the same. After the generation process is done, the user can explore the universe in 3D.
