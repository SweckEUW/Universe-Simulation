I created this software together with 3 fellow students for a Computer Graphics and Image Processing course. You can create your own universe by scanning an image! Simply draw an image and scan the image inside of the software to create the universe. The user can define various attributes like planet types, distance between planets and planet sizes inside the image. The planets are procedural generated by using a noise function and therefore never look the same. Afterwards the user can explore the universe in 3D.
