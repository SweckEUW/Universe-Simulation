I created this software together with 3 colleagues for a Computer Graphics and Image Processing course. 
You can create your own universe using an image, either hand drawn or computer generated. 
The image gets scanned and the software creates procedural Planets out of it. The planets are created, 
using a noise function and therefore never look the same. The user can define his universe through the Image,
for example planet sizes, planet types, ammount of planets and more.
